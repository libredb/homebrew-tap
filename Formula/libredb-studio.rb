# ==============================================================================
# Homebrew formula template for libredb-studio (issue #111).
#
# Rendered by scripts/render-homebrew-formula.mjs: the version and the four
# per-platform sha256 placeholders are filled from the SHA256SUMS file
# attached to the GitHub release, then the result is pushed to
# libredb/homebrew-tap as Formula/libredb-studio.rb by
# .github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml. Never edit the rendered formula in
# the tap by hand - change this template and re-release.

  # The standalone payload runs under Node and ships a better-sqlite3 native
  # binding compiled against the Node 24 ABI in release CI. The floating
  # "node" formula tracks the latest major (satisfying the engines range but
  # not the ABI: loading the binding there fails with ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED), so
  # pin the versioned formula - matching the Node 24 runtime bundled into the
  # deb/rpm/snap channels by packaging/linux/fetch-node.sh.
